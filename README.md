## Problem
In summer 2021, Minnesota offered a $100 Visa gift card to residents who received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose between July 30 and August 22. The state invested significant resources in this incentive program to boost vaccination rates. Did it work? This analysis evaluates whether the financial incentive detectably increased vaccination uptake using quasi-experimental methods.

## Approach
**Method:** Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis comparing vaccination trends before and after the incentive launch
**Data sources:** CDC COVID-19 vaccination data (national and state-level)

**Key techniques:**

Trend comparison: Minnesota vs. national vaccination rates
Interrupted Time Series (ITS)
Visual analysis of vaccination time series

**Tools:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, statistical modeling packages)

## Key Findings

**No statistically significant increase in vaccination rates attributable to the $100 incentive.** Minnesota's vaccination trajectory followed similar patterns to national trends during the incentive period, suggesting the program did not substantially accelerate uptake beyond existing momentum. At the same time was an increase in the United States in vaccinations since late July, perhaps due to news around the Delta variant.
